## Metrics

Heapster exports the following metrics to its backends.

| network/tx         | Cumulative number of bytes sent over the network                                                   | Cumulative | Bytes       | v0.9            |
| network/tx_errors  | Cumulative number of errors while sending over the network                                         | Cumulative | Count       | v0.9            |

*Note: Gauge refers to instantaneous metrics*

## Labels

Heapster tags each metric with the following labels.

| Label Name     | Description                                                                   | Supported Since | Kubernetes specific |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| pod_id         | Unique ID of a Pod                                                            | v0.9            | Yes                 |
| container_name | User-provided name of the container or full cgroup name for system containers | v0.9            | No                  |
| labels         | Comma-separated list of user-provided labels. Format is 'key:value'           | v0.9            | Yes                 |
| hostname       | Hostname where the container ran                                              | v0.9            | No                  |


## Storage Schema

### InfluxDB

Each metric translates to a separate 'series' in InfluxDB. Labels are stored as additional columns.
The series name is constructed by combining the metric name with its type and units: "metric Name"_"units"_"type".

###### Query
`list series`

###### Output
```
cpu/usage_ns_cumulative
memory/page_faults_gauge
memory/usage_bytes_gauge
memory/working_set_bytes_gauge
network/rx_bytes_cumulative
network/rx_errors_cumulative
network/tx_bytes_cumulative
network/tx_errors_cumulative
uptime_ms_cumulative
```
*Note: Unit 'Count' is ignored*

Heapster adds timestamp and sequence number to every metric.

### Google Cloud Monitoring

Metrics mentioned above are stored along with corresponding labels as custom metrics in Google Cloud Monitoring.
Each metric is pushed with an additonal namespace prefix `kubernetes.io`.
TODO: Add more information about GCM support.
