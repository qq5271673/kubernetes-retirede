## Metrics

Heapster exports the following metrics to its backends.

| network/tx         | Cumulative number of bytes sent over the network                                                   | Cumulative | Bytes       | v0.9            |
| network/tx_errors  | Cumulative number of errors while sending over the network                                         | Cumulative | Count       | v0.9            |

*Note: Gauge refers to instantaneous metrics*

## Labels

Heapster tags each metric with the following labels.

| Label Name     | Description                                                                   | Supported Since | Kubernetes specific |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| pod_id         | Unique ID of a Pod                                                            | v0.9            | Yes                 |
| pod_name       | User-provided name of a Pod                                                   | HEAD            | Yes                 |
| pod_namespace  | The namespace of a Pod                                                        | v0.10           | Yes                 |
| container_name | User-provided name of the container or full cgroup name for system containers | v0.9            | No                  |
| labels         | Comma-separated list of user-provided labels. Format is 'key:value'           | v0.9            | Yes                 |
| hostname       | Hostname where the container ran                                              | v0.9            | No                  |
| resource_id    | An unique identifier used to differentiate multiple metrics of the same type. e.x. Fs partitions under filesystem/usage | HEAD | No |


## Storage Schema

### InfluxDB

Each metric translates to a separate 'series' in InfluxDB. Labels are stored as additional columns.
The series name is constructed by combining the metric name with its type and units: "metric Name"_"units"_"type".

###### Query
`list series`

###### Output
```
cpu/usage_ns_cumulative
filesystem/usage
memory/page_faults_gauge
memory/usage_bytes_gauge
memory/working_set_bytes_gauge
network/rx_bytes_cumulative
network/rx_errors_cumulative
network/tx_bytes_cumulative
network/tx_errors_cumulative
uptime_ms_cumulative
```
*Note: Unit 'Count' is ignored*

Heapster adds timestamp and sequence number to every metric.

### Google Cloud Monitoring

Metrics mentioned above are stored along with corresponding labels as [custom metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/) in Google Cloud Monitoring.

* Metrics are collected every 2 minutes by default and pushed with a 1 minute precision.
* Each metric has a custom metric prefix - `custom.cloudmonitoring.googleapis.com`
* Each metric is pushed with an additonal namespace prefix - `kubernetes.io`.
* GCM does not support visualizing cumulative metrics yet. To work around that, heapster exports an equivalent gauge metric for all cumulative metrics mentioned above.

  The gauge metrics use their parent cumulative metric name as the prefix, followed by a "_rate" suffix. 
   E.x.: "cpu/usage", which is cumulative, will have a corresponding gauge metric "cpu/usage_rate"
   NOTE: The gauge metrics will be deprecated as soon as GCM supports visualizing cumulative metrics.

TODO: Add a snapshot of all the metrics stored in GCM.
